                <h2>Mottai</h2>
                <p>(もったい) is a word that can be traced back to the Japanese Buddhist term "motsu-tai," which means "to
                    have the sense of possession."
                    In the context of mottainai, it refers to the value or potential of something. It is used to
                    describe the idea that everything
                    in the world has inherent value, and it is a waste to discard something that still has usefulness or
                    potential.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>(ない), is a negative suffix that indicates the absence or lack of something.</p>

    <h4> Reduce</h4>
    <p>This refers to reducing the amount of waste we create by consuming less and making more conscious
        choices about what we purchase. The idea is to minimize our environmental impact by using fewer
        resources and producing less waste.</p>

    <h4>Resuse</h4>
    <p>Rusing means finding ways to use products and materials multiple times before they are disposed of.
        This can involve repairing or repurposing items, donating or selling them, or using refillable
        containers instead of single-use ones.</p>

    </section>
    <section class="r34">
        <h4>Recycle</h4>
        <p>Recycling involves processing waste materials so that they can be turned into new products. This process
            helps
            to conserve natural resources and reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. However, it's
            important to
            note that recycling should not be seen as a solution to our waste problem on its own - reducing and reusing
            should be
            prioritized first.</p>

        <h4>Respect</h4>
        <p>Respect for the environment means recognizing the interconnectedness of all living things and treating the
            natural world with care and consideration. This involves taking responsibility for our actions and making
            choices that support the health and
            sustainability of the planet. It can also involve advocating for policies and practices that protect the
            environment and its inhabitants.</p>
